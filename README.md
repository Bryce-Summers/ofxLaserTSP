# ofxLaserTSP

Optimizes the traveling salesman problem for a set of double ended paths.

# Status
Being tested in practice now.

# Closed problem (Cycle).

# Open problem (Path).

Please note that a solution to the open problem is simply a solution to the closed problem without its longest edge.

# Future Work.
I've got a bunch of ideas for making this faster, more efficient, and working for larger problem sizes.
Right now it is designed for the needs of those who have originally commissioned this work.
